          <h1> CIPHER SHIELD </h1><br/>
           <p> Cipher shield is a website that helps user to encrypt or decrypt any file. <br/> The file can be of any format let it be image, pdf, text document, word document, excel sheet, videos. <br/> Cipher Shield is one stop solution for all your files. All your files would get converted in easy and convinent manner in no time.
              
          <br/><br/>ENCRYPTING A FILE MEANS:<br/>It’s the process of transforming readable data into an unreadable format. It uses mathematical algorithms to achieve<br/> this and can be performed on any kind of data, including emails, documents, and messages. Encryption is often used<br/> in the digital world, where it’s applied to files, emails, and even entire hard drives. It’s also used in securing wireless networks<br/> and is the backbone of many online banking systems. Without encryption, our data would be vulnerable to anyone <br/>who wants to see it. Another thing to consider is that encryption keys are generated by two different algorithms — symmetrical <br/>and asymmetrical. Symmetrical algorithm allows for a shared key between users on both ends, while asymmetrical algorithm<br/> requires two keys (one public and one private) for each user. This means that even if someone obtains your public key, <br/>they still need your private key to decrypt your data — adding an extra layer of security.

               <br/><br/> DECRYPTING A FILE MEANS:<br/>Decryption is the process of transforming encrypted data into its original form so that humans can read it.<br/>
This is done by reversing the encryption process, using the same algorithm, key, or password.<br/>There are many different applications for decryption, including recovering lost or forgotten passwords, <br/>accessing encrypted data for analysis, and restoring files that have been damaged or corrupted.<br/> In some cases, decryption may also be used to remove security measures from files or systems so that they can </p>
